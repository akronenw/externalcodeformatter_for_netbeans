OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
	This plugin helps you to apply to a common code style in a team of Eclipse JDT and NetBeans IDE users. \
	The original formatting engine of Eclipse is embedded and allows you to format the sourcecode the same way as your Eclipse co-workers do. \
	You only have to provide an Eclipse formatter configuration file. Besides you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/google/google-java-format">Google Code Formatter</a> which has also plugins for Eclipse and IntelliJ.\n\
	<h3>\n<font color="#FF0000">Known issue: When the Eclipse or Google formatter is used the line-breakpoints at the formatted lines are lost. Class/Method/Field breakpoints will be preserved.</font>\n</h3>\n\
	<h2>Features:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Global configuration and project specific configuration</li>\n<li>On save action (Disabled by default)</li>\n<li>Shows the used formatter in a notification (Disabled by default)</li>\n<li>Supports profiles (since 1.6)</li>\n<li>Supports format of selected text (since 1.7)</li>\n<li>Preserve breakpoints (experimental) (since 1.8)</li>\n<li>Code templates for @formatter:on/off (since 1.9)</li>\n<li>Supports <a href="https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/workspacemechanic/">Workspace Mechanic</a> configuration file (since 1.10)</li>\n<li>Support configuration from .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs (absolute and relative paths) (since 1.10)</li>\n<li>On save action: Introduced option for formatting only the changed lines (since 1.10)</li>\n<li>Support configuration of linefeed (since 1.10)</li>\n<li>Support configuration of source level (since 1.10)</li>\n<li>Support for macro invocation (since 1.12)</li>\n<li>Support for guarded documents (documents that are created by the NetBeans GUI builder, guarded blocks are skipped of course, but everything in between can be formatted) (since 1.13)</li>\n</ul>\
	\n\n</ul>\n<h2>Note:</h2>\nPlease note that this plugin only provides support for formatting. \
	Eclipse users may miss the application of save-actions like "adding @Override annotations" or "member sort order". \
	Such AST-based transformations are not provided by this plugin.\n\n\
