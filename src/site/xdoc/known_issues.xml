					Updating the breakpoints after formatting acts not exactly the same way as for the internal
					NetBeans formatter, but it's pretty close.
				</li>
				<li>
					Guarded blocks are not supported for the Google Java Code Formatter. There seems to be a bug
					in the Google Java Code Formatter which prevents this feature to work. Further details on
					this bug can be watched here:

				<li>
					It's not possible to sort the imports with the Eclipse Formatter as it needs some OSGi/Eclipse
					Equinox Runtime related classes to initialize the related objects. But you can configure
					NetBeans to do the sorting exactly as Eclipse does by default. Just go to &quote;Preferences&quote;
					-&gt; &quote;Editor&quote; -&gt; &quote;Formatting&quote; -&gt; Choose &quote;Java&quote; as the
					&quote;Language&quote; and &quote;Imports&quote; as the &quote;Category&quote; and configure the
					following &quote;Import Layout&quote;:
					<ol>
						<li>java</li>
						<li>javax</li>
						<li>org</li>
						<li>com</li>
						<li>&lt;all other imports&gt;</li>
					</ol>
					and make a check &quote;Separate Groups&quote;
				</li>
